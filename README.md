AI Ethics & Governance Framework: The CLEAR Model
Author: Sarvesh Adittya Murali Desan

Project Role: Intern, Group Business Ethics & Integrity (GBEI)

Institution: Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad

Project Overview
This repository contains a 10-page whitepaper proposing a governance structure for AI in the ASEAN financial sector. The research introduces the CLEAR Framework—a model designed to bridge the gap between innovation and ethical compliance.

Institutional Integration
The CLEAR Model was developed to align with Kenanga's Group Ethics Blueprint and 3-Year Ethics Implementation Plan. It provides GBEI with a structured approach to oversee AI risks such as algorithmic bias and lack of explainability.

The CLEAR Framework:
Consent: Transparency in customer AI interactions.
Limitations: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) safeguards.
Equity: Fairness audits using SHAP explainability tools.
Accountability: Assigned board ownership and escalation channels.
Regulation: Alignment with BNM RMIT and the MACC Act.
